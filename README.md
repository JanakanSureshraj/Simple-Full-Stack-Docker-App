# Simple-Full-Stack-Docker-App
A web app I had developed to learn the basics of docker, virtual machines, and cloud deployment. This project might be small in scale but it integrates a React frontend, a Node.js/Express.js backend, and MongoDB for data storage. CRUD operations can be performed on messages to validate the client-server communication. Once pushed to Docker Hub, containers can be pulled for deployment on a specific cloud service.
